# Task-1
Creating a bar chart or histogram
1. Load the Dataset
First, you need to download the dataset and load it into a DataFrame. For this example, I'll assume you've downloaded the dataset as a CSV file named world_population.csv.
code:
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
url = 'https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?downloadformat=csv'
data = pd.read_csv(url, skiprows=4)  # Skipping the first few rows that are not part of the data

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

2)Clean the Data
Check the data for any issues such as missing values or irrelevant columns.
# Display basic info about the dataset
print(data.info())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Drop any unnecessary columns
data = data[['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Year', 'Value']]

# Rename columns for easier access
data.columns = ['Country', 'Country_Code', 'Year', 'Population']

# Drop rows with missing population data
data = data.dropna(subset=['Population'])

3)
Let's create a bar chart and a histogram to visualize the distribution of a variable using the World Bank dataset you provided. The dataset from the World Bank contains information on total population across countries and years, which is a continuous variable.

Here's how you can visualize the distribution of total population using Python. We'll use libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for this purpose.

1. Load the Dataset
First, you need to download the dataset and load it into a DataFrame. For this example, I'll assume you've downloaded the dataset as a CSV file named world_population.csv.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
url = 'https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?downloadformat=csv'
data = pd.read_csv(url, skiprows=4)  # Skipping the first few rows that are not part of the data

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
2. Clean the Data
Check the data for any issues such as missing values or irrelevant columns.

python
Copy code
# Display basic info about the dataset
print(data.info())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Drop any unnecessary columns
data = data[['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Year', 'Value']]

# Rename columns for easier access
data.columns = ['Country', 'Country_Code', 'Year', 'Population']

# Drop rows with missing population data
data = data.dropna(subset=['Population'])
3. Plot the Distribution of the Population
Histogram of World Population
Let's create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the total world population across the years
code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set the style for seaborn
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create a histogram of the population
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['Population'], kde=True, bins=30)
plt.title('Distribution of World Population')
plt.xlabel('Population')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

4)Bar Chart of Population by Country
To create a bar chart, let's visualize the total population for each country in a specific year. We'll aggregate the population data by country for a chosen year.
code:
# Filter data for a specific year, for example, 2020
data_2020 = data[data['Year'] == 2020]

# Sort by population
data_2020 = data_2020.sort_values(by='Population', ascending=False)

# Create a bar chart of population by country
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(x='Population', y='Country', data=data_2020.head(20))  # Top 20 countries by population
plt.title('Top 20 Most Populous Countries in 2020')
plt.xlabel('Population')
plt.ylabel('Country')
plt.show()

*Summary
Histogram: This visualization helps to understand the distribution of the world population over different values. It's useful for identifying patterns, such as if most countries have a small or large population.
Bar Chart: This chart shows the top 20 most populous countries for a specific year, allowing you to compare the population sizes of the largest countries.
